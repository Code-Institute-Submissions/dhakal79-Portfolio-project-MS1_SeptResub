### Project Goals

The main goal of this website is to make module "unit operation in water treatment" online for student who would like to follow the course from distance. 

## Skeleton
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format. The concept design (wireframes) of webpages (3 pages) prepared is presented below.
