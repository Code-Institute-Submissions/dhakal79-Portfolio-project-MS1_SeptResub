# 1. User Expereince (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on university teaching is to turn face to face teaching to online learning. It was a challenge for lecturer to switch all face to face teaching to online learning. This project is aimed to provide a platform where students can learn online for a module name" 
  unit operation in water treatment". 

  The following users types can be benifitted from the website:

* Professionals dealing with engineering, management and education in the fields of water supply and wastewater and urban infrastructure.
* Post graduate students in environmental engineering. 
* Participants from government organisations ( both local and national agencies), non-governmental organisations and the private sector.

<a name="user-expectations"></a>
## 1.2 User Expectations
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The website content provides state-of-the-art knowledge and experience on the technologies and design practices of conventional water treatment systems. The site can be an ideal for practicing engineers who are working in the water supply and sewerage systems. Folloiwng user's expections are considered while designing the site:
* The site structure is designed considering the expectation of users to be simple and easy to use.
* The user interface is easy to navigate (inlcude main navigation bar, drop dwon menu bar and a link at bottom of page that user can go back to top of the page in just one click).
* Responsive design for all screen/device sizes like mobile, tablet and desktop.
* Feedback/course evalaution page provided where users can provide their comments and suggestion for future improvement
* a link for application provided for those users who will be interested to take this course faceto face at IHE Delft.

<a name="color-scheme"></a>
## 1.4 Color Scheme
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The choice of website right foreground and background colour is essential that decides the site visitors wheather to emote the site or not. In this design we consider the accessibility guideline i.e, contrast between background and foreground colours. We make use of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)  to select the background and foreground color. Here is an example how the choice of background and foreground is decided to the site.
![color contrast](./assets/images/color-contrast.jpg)

Other foreground and background color used in the sites are
* foreground: #046231
* background: #ffffff

## 1.5 Audio-Video/Images
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
This website consider of having images, audio/video that helps the users to understand the content easily. Having picture, audio/video consider worth a thousand words‚Äù when creating a web application. As far as possible all the images, video included in the website, is considered to be of high quality. The included audio/video is provided with control actions such as playing of audio/video that allows the user to initiate and control the actions.

## 1.6 Site Skeleton

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format. The concept design (wireframes) of webpages (3 pages) prepared is presented below.

# 2. Features
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
 ### All 3 pages:
- Navigation bar is placed at the top right corner of the page, and cosnidered a hover effect that changes the colour (with green box) when we want to click the page. The hover effect is placed to improve the user expereince. 
- Drop down menu bar is provided to the main menu bar of the theory.html page
- Logo of IHE Delft is placed on the top left corner 
- Background color of menu bar and foreground color were chosen considering the contrast between background and foreground colours. We make use of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to select the background and foreground color.
- Social media links (for facebook, Linkden, Twitter and Youtube) are placed at the bottom of the each page in the footer. All the links will open in a new tab. 
- Back to top link provided to each page at the bottom left corner. this will allow the visitor to access to the top oif page in one click.

### Introduction page:
- Water image is included just below the menubar to highlight that this website provides information about water. We provide zoom animation to the image to attract the attention of the user.
- The page contain the title of the module "Unit Operation in Water Treatment" and below which which provided this divisions (using flex properties). The first division (left) provides information about aim of the module, learning objectives, the second division (middle) provides information about when to apply for the course and contact details of the module coordinator. finally, the last division contain a module introduction video (self recorded). 
- An external link "Apply here" provided where interested users can apply for a face to face course.
- Summary of topics to be covered in this module is presented in the bottom of the page (just above the social media link) using the property flex.

The screenshot of introduction page is below:

  Introduction page UI:
  ![introduction page preview](./assets/images/introdcution-end-product.jpg)

### Theory page:
- This page provides theory of coagulation process in water treatment
- page provides information in both text as well as graphs.
- This page also provides the Table of content that helps users what topics needs to be covered in this course

The screenshot of theory page is below:

 Theory page UI:
  ![theory page preview](./assets/images/theory-end-product.jpg)


### Feedback page:
- Include contact form that provides the user the ability to message site owner, provide feedback and suggestions. 
- Inlcude module evaluation forms where users can choose the options from (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree) using radio-button option.
- Provide Submit and Reset buttons with hoever effect on it
- The form use the method="POST" action="https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/"
- I use the option of placeholder for full name and email address.

The screenshot of feedback page is below:

## 4.1 Automated testing
### 4.1.1 Google Developer Tools
I make use of google developer tools (Chrome DevTools) as debugging tools. Using this tool i inspect for every elements that I added in HTML and CSS style. Once I was happy with, I copy the CSS style code from Chrome DevTools and paste in my CSS style sheet.

### 4.1.2 Responsive Tools

In order to make sure that design web pages are responsive to all device sizes, [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) site was used to check it. 

### 4.1.3 W3C Validator Tools

[W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) was used to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

![W3C HTML Validation](./assets/images/W3Chtml.jpg)
The HTML checker notified me an error in my index.html page. it suggested that i should consider using h2-h6 elements to the section with id='animation" in the page. 

The identified error was corrected by switching section to div and no error was found as shown in picture below.
![W3C HTML error corrected](./assets/images/w3chtml-corrected.jpg)

[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet. No errors were found.
