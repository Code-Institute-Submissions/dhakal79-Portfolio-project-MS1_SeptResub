# 1. User Expereince (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on university teaching is to turn face to face teaching to online learning. It was a challenge for lecturer to switch all face to face teaching to online learning. This project is aimed to provide a platform where students can learn online for a module name" 
  unit operation in water treatment". 

  The following users types can be benifitted from the website:

* Professionals dealing with engineering, management and education in the fields of water supply and wastewater and urban infrastructure.
* Post graduate students in environmental engineering. 
* Participants from government organisations ( both local and national agencies), non-governmental organisations and the private sector.

## 1.2 User Expectations
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The website content provides state-of-the-art knowledge and experience on the technologies and design practices of conventional water treatment systems. The site can be an ideal for practicing engineers who are working in the water supply and sewerage systems. Folloiwng user's expections are considered while designing the site:
* The site structure is designed considering the expectation of users to be simple and easy to use.
* The user interface is easy to navigate (inlcude main navigation bar, drop dwon menu bar and a link at bottom of page that user can go back to top of the page in just one click).
* Responsive design for all screen/device sizes like mobile, tablet and desktop.
* Feedback/course evalaution page provided where users can provide their comments and suggestion for future improvement
* a link for application provided for those users who will be interested to take this course faceto face at IHE Delft.

<a name="color-scheme"></a>
## 1.4 Color Scheme
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The choice of website right foreground and background colour is essential that decides the site visitors wheather to emote the site or not. In this design we consider the accessibility guideline i.e, contrast between background and foreground colours. We make use of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)  to select the background and foreground color. Here is an example how the choice of background and foreground is decided to the site.
![color contrast](./assets/images/color-contrast.jpg)

Other foreground and background color used in the sites are
* foreground: #046231
* background: #ffffff

## 1.5 Audio-Video/Images
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
This website consider of having images, audio/video that helps the users to understand the content easily. Having picture, audio/video consider worth a thousand words‚Äù when creating a web application. As far as possible all the images, video included in the website, is considered to be of high quality. The included audio/video is provided with control actions such as playing of audio/video that allows the user to initiate and control the actions.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format. The concept design (wireframes) of webpages (3 pages) prepared is presented below.

* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) (markup language) was used for structuring and presenting content of the website.
 
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) was used to provide the style to the content written in a HTML.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website (desktop and mobile version).
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import font-family "Lato" and "Oswald" into style,css file and which was used throughout the pages of the website.
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) was used to resize some of the site images.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to improt icons to the sites.
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) was used to debug and test the source code using HTML5 as well as to test site responsiveness.
* [Github](https://github.com/) was used to create the repository and to store the cproject's code after pushed from Git.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the Code Editor for the site

* [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was used to select the background and font color in the website.
* [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [Jigsaw validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) tools were used to validate the HTML code and CSS style used in the proejct.
* [Ami](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to develop a Mockup screenshot generator

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
## 4.1 Automated testing
### 4.1.1 Google Developer Tools
I make use of google developer tools (Chrome DevTools) as debugging tools. Using this tool i inspect for every elements that I added in HTML and CSS style. Once I was happy with, I copy the CSS style code from Chrome DevTools and paste in my CSS style sheet.

### 4.1.2 Responsive Tools

In order to make sure that design web pages are responsive to all device sizes, [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) site was used to check it. 

### 4.1.3 W3C Validator Tools

[W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) was used to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

![W3C HTML Validation](./assets/images/W3Chtml.jpg)
The HTML checker notified me an error in my index.html page. it suggested that i should consider using h2-h6 elements to the section with id='animation" in the page. The error was solved by giving div instead of section.

[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet. No errors were found.

## 4.2 Manual Testing

I have tested my site on multiple devices. These include:
  - Galaxy S5 (360 x 640)
  - iPhone 6/7/8 (375 x 667) 
  - iPhone 6/7/8 plus (414 x 736)
  - ipad (768 x 1024)
  - iPhone XS Max
  - iPad Pro (1024 x 1366)
  - Huawei P20 Pro

The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps:
- Sign up to GutHub
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Click on settings on the navigation bar under the repository title.
- Select pages on the left menu bar.
- Click on the master branch and save.
- This will now generate a link with your website live.
